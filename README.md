# Movie Browsing App Backend

This Node.js backend serves as the server for the Movie Browsing App and includes a proxy API. The proxy API acts as an intermediary between the frontend and external APIs, such as the OMDB API, allowing your frontend to fetch and display movie data.

This guide will walk you through the process of connecting your frontend to the server.js using the proxy API.
